# Vehicle Dataset Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) Project

## Overview

This repository contains the work from a personal project focused on performing Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a vehicle dataset. The goal of this project is to extract meaningful insights from the data, which can be used to improve vehicle performance and operational efficiency. The project involved data preparation, cleaning, analysis, and summarizing the findings into actionable recommendations.

## Files in the Repository

1. **Vehicle_Dataset_EDA_Project.ipynb**:
   - A Jupyter Notebook documenting the entire EDA process applied to the vehicle dataset.
   - Sections include:
     - **Data Loading and Preparation**: Importing and organizing the dataset for analysis.
     - **Data Cleaning**: Steps taken to handle missing values, outliers, and any inconsistencies in the data.
     - **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Visualization and statistical analysis of various vehicle-related parameters to uncover trends and patterns.
     - **Feature Engineering**: Creation and modification of features to enhance the analysis.
     - **Conclusions and Recommendations**: Key insights drawn from the analysis, along with suggestions for improving vehicle operations.

2. **vehicle_dataset.csv**:
   - The dataset used in this project, which contains various parameters related to vehicle performance, health, and usage. This CSV file serves as the raw data source for the analysis conducted in the notebook.

3. **Project_Summary_Report.pdf**:
   - A concise summary report of the project, highlighting the most important findings, visualizations, and recommendations. This document is intended to provide a quick overview of the project's outcomes without needing to go through the entire notebook.

## Project Objectives

- **Data Preparation**: Ensure the dataset is well-structured and ready for analysis.
- **Data Cleaning**: Address missing values and outliers to maintain data integrity.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis**: Explore and visualize the data to uncover key insights related to vehicle performance.
- **Feature Engineering**: Develop new features that can potentially improve the analysis or provide additional insights.
- **Conclusions and Recommendations**: Based on the analysis, provide actionable recommendations to enhance vehicle operations.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ManjitSingh2003/vehicle-dataset-eda.git
   ```
2. **Dataset**:
